# nvim-sidekick-dashboard

Remake of [this](https://github.com/phenax/sidekick-dashboard) dashboard thing built entirely in neovim + neorg because web always disappoints.
Only works with neorg for the content because that's all I really need.

The deadline virtual text on the side is built into this thing. Might extract that out into it's own plugin in the future.
